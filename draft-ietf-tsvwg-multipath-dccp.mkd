--- abstract


DCCP communication is currently restricted to a single path per
connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers.  The
simultaneous use of these multiple paths for a DCCP session could
improve resource usage within the network and, thus, improve user
experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to
network failures.
Use cases for a Multipath DCCP (MP-DCCP) are mobile devices (handsets, vehicles) and residential home gateways simultaneously connected to distinct paths as, e.g., 
a cellular link and a WiFi link
or to a mobile radio station and a fixed access network.  Compared to existing multipath protocols such as MPTCP, MP-DCCP provides specific support for non-TCP user
traffic as UDP or plain IP.  More details on potential use cases are provided in {{website}}, {{slide}}, and {{paper}}.
All these use cases profit from an Open Source Linux reference implementation provided under {{website}}.

This document presents a set of extensions to
traditional DCCP to support multipath operation.  Multipath DCCP provides 
the ability to simultaneously use multiple
paths between peers.  The protocol offers
the same type of service to applications as DCCP and it provides the
components necessary to establish and use multiple DCCP flows across
potentially disjoint paths.

# Introduction {#intro}

Multipath DCCP (MP-DCCP) is a set of extensions to regular DCCP
{{RFC4340}}, i.e., the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol denoting a
transport protocol that provides bidirectional unicast connections of
congestion-controlled unreliable datagrams. A multipath extension to 
DCCP enables the transport of user data  across multiple paths 
simultaneously. This is beneficial to applications that transfer fairly 
large amounts of data, due to the possibility to aggregate capacity of the 
multiple paths. In addition, it enables to tradeoff timeliness and reliability, 
which is important for low latency applications that do not require 
guaranteed delivery services such as Audio/Video streaming.
DCCP multipath operation is suggested
in the context of ongoing 3GPP work on 5G multi-access solutions
{{I-D.amend-tsvwg-multipath-framework-mpdccp}} and for hybrid access
networks {{I-D.lhwxz-hybrid-access-network-architecture}}{{I-D.muley-network-based-bonding-hybrid-access}}.
It can be applied for load-balancing, seamless session handover, and
aggregation purposes (referred to as ATSSS; Access steering, switching, and splitting
in 3GPP terminology {{TS23.501}}).

This document presents the protocol changes required to add multipath
capability to DCCP; specifically, those for signaling and setting up
multiple paths ("subflows"), managing these subflows, reordering of
data, and termination of sessions.
DCCP, as stated in {{RFC4340}} does not provide reliable and ordered
delivery. Consequently, multiple application subflows may be multiplexed over a
single DCCP connection with no inherent performance penalty 
for flows that do not require in-ordered delivery. DCCP
does not provide built-in support for those multiple application subflows.

In the following, use of the term subflow will refer to physical
separate DCCP subflows transmitted via different paths, but not to
application subflows. Application subflows are differing content-wise
by source and destination port per application as, for example, enabled
by Service Codes introduced to DCCP in {{RFC5595}}, and those subflows
can be multiplexed over a single DCCP connection. For sake of consistency
we assume that only a single application is served by a DCCP connection
here as shown in {{ref-comparison-of-standard-dccp-and-mp-dccp-protocol-stacks}}
while use of that feature should not impact DCCP operation on each single path
as noted in ({{RFC5595}}, sect. 2.4).

## Multipath DCCP in the Networking Stack {#mpdccp_network_stack}

MP-DCCP operates at the transport layer and aims to be transparent to
both higher and lower layers.  It is a set of additional features on
top of standard DCCP; {{ref-comparison-of-standard-dccp-and-mp-dccp-protocol-stacks}} illustrates this layering.  MP-DCCP is
designed to be used by applications in the same way as DCCP with no
changes to the application itself.

## Terminology {#terminology}

Throughout this document we make use of terms that are either specific
for multipath transport or are defined in the context of MP-DCCP,
similar to {{RFC8684}}, as follows:
 
Path: A sequence of links between a sender and a receiver, defined in
this context by a 4-tuple of source and destination address/ port pairs.

Subflow: A flow of DCCP segments operating over an individual path,
which forms part of a larger MP-DCCP connection. A subflow is started
and terminated similar to a regular (single-path) DCCP connection.

(MP-DCCP) Connection: A set of one or more subflows, over which an
application can communicate between two hosts. There is a one-to-one
mapping between a connection and an application socket.

Token: A locally unique identifier given to a multipath connection by a
host. May also be referred to as a "Connection ID".

Host: An end host operating an MP-DCCP implementation, and either
initiating or accepting an MP-DCCP connection. In addition to these
terms, within framework of MP-DCCP the interpretation of, and effect on,
regular single-path DCCP semantics is discussed in {{protocol}}.

## Differences from Multipath TCP {#diff_mptcp}

Multipath DCCP is similar to Multipath TCP {{RFC8684}}, in that it
extends the related basic DCCP transport protocol {{RFC4340}} with
multipath capabilities in the same way as Multipath TCP extends TCP
{{RFC0793}}.
However, because of the differences between the underlying TCP and DCCP
protocols, the transport characteristics of MPTCP and MP-DCCP are
different.

{{table_tcp_dccp_comp}} compares the protocol characteristics of TCP
and DCCP, which are by nature inherited by their respective multipath
extensions.  A major difference lies in the delivery of payload, which
is for TCP an exact copy of the generated byte-stream. DCCP behaves
in a different way and does not guarantee to deliver any payload nor the
order of delivery.
Since this is mainly affecting the receiving endpoint of a TCP or
DCCP communication, many similarities on the sender side can be identified.
Both transport protocols share the 3-way initiation of a
communication and both employ congestion control to adapt the sending
rate to the path characteristics.

| Feature                | TCP              | DCCP                          |

{: #table_tcp_dccp_comp title='TCP and DCCP protocol comparison'}

Consequently, the multipath features, shown in
{{table_mptcp_mpdccp_comp}}, are the same, supporting volatile paths
having varying capacity and latency, session handover and path
aggregation capabilities. All of them profit by the existence of
congestion control.

| Feature                      | MPTCP                 | MP-DCCP            |
|:----------------------------:|:---------------------:|:------------------:|
| Volatile paths               | yes                   | yes                |
| Session handover             | yes                   | yes                |
| Path aggregation             | yes                   | yes                |
| Data reordering              | yes                   | optional / modular |
| Expandability                | limited by TCP header | flexible           |
{: #table_mptcp_mpdccp_comp title='MPTCP and MP-DCCP protocol comparison'}

Therefore, the sender logic is not much different between MP-DCCP and
MPTCP.

The receiver side for MP-DCCP has to deal with the unreliable transport 
character of DCCP, and can provide flexible handling for data stream packet 
reordering for those applications where it is beneficial. However, many 
applications that use unreliable transport protocols can inherently deal 
with out-of-sequence data (e.g., through adaptive audio and video buffers), 
and so additional reordering support may not be necessary. The optional 
reordering mechanisms in MP-DCCP are most likely to be required when the 
different DCCP subflows are routed across paths with different latencies. 
In theory, applications using DCCP are aware that packet reordering might 
happen, since DCCP has no mechanisms to prevent it.

The receiving process for MPTCP is on the other hand a rigid
"just wait" approach, since TCP guarantees reliable delivery.


## Requirements Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in {{RFC2119}}.



# Operation Overview {#op_overview}

RFC 4340 states that some applications might want to share congestion
control state among multiple DCCP flows between same source and
destination addresses. This functionality could be provided by the
Congestion Manager (CM) {{RFC3124}}, a generic multiplexing facility. 
However, the CM would not fully support MP-DCCP without change; it does
not gracefully handle multiple congestion control mechanisms, for example.

The operation of MP-DCCP for data transfer takes one input data stream
from an application, and splits it into one or more subflows, with
sufficient control information to allow received data to be re-assembled 
for in-order delivery to the recipient application. The following 
subsections define this behavior in detail.

The Multipath Capability for MP-DCCP can be negotiated with a new DCCP
feature, as described in {{protocol}}.
Once negotiated, all subsequent MP-DCCP operations are signalled with a
variable length multipath-related option, as described in {{mp_capable}}.


# MP-DCCP Protocol {#protocol}

The DCCP protocol feature list ({{RFC4340}} section 6.4) will be
enhanced by a new Multipath related feature with Feature number 10, as
shown in {{ref-feature-list}}.

Rec'n Rule:
: The reconciliation rule used for the feature. SP means server-priority,
  NN means non-negotiable.

Initial Value:
: The initial value for the feature. Every feature has a known initial value.

Req'd:
: This column is "Y" if and only if every DCCP implementation MUST
understand the feature. If it is "N", then the feature behaves like an extension
(see Section 15), and it is safe to respond to Change options for the feature
with empty Confirm options. Of course, a CCID might require the feature; a DCCP
that implements CCID 2 MUST support Ack Ratio and Send Ack Vector, for example.

The DCCP protocol options as defined in ({{RFC4340}} section 5.8) and ({{RFC5634}} section 2.2.1) will be enhanced
by a new Multipath related variable-length option with option type 46, as
shown in {{ref-option-list}}.

[Tbd/tbv] In addition to the multipath option, MP-DCCP requires particular 
considerations for:



* The minimum PMTU of the individual paths must be announced to the application.
  Changes of individual path PMTUs must be re-announced to the application
  if they result in a value lower than the currently announced PMTU.

* Overall sequencing for optional reordering procedure

* Congestion control covering specific mechanisms as, e.g., for detecting and
  reporting congestion occurrence on per-path level and for individual
  adaptation of path-specific transmission rates (up to zero rate)


## Multipath Capable Feature {#mp_capable}

DCCP endpoints are multipath-disabled by default and multipath
capability can be negotiated with the Multipath Capable Feature.

Multipath Capable has feature number 10 and is server-priority. It takes
one-byte values.
The first four bits are used to specify compatible versions of the
MP-DCCP implementation. The following four bits are reserved for further
use.

MP_CONFIRM is used to send confirmation of reception and processing of the multipath 
options that require it (see {{ref-mp-option-confirm}}). Such options will be retransmitted by the sender 
until this receives the corresponding MP_CONFIRM. The length and sending path of the MP_CONFIRM are dependent 
on the confirmed options, which will be copied verbatim and appended as list of options.

### MP_ADDADDR {#MP_ADDADDR}

The MP_ADDADDR option announces additional addresses (and, optionally,
ports) on which a host can be reached. This option can be used at any
time during an existing DCCP connection, when the sender wishes to
enable multiple paths and/or when additional paths become available.
Length is variable depending on IPv4 or IPv6 and whether port number is
used and is in range between 28 and 42 bytes.

Every address has an Address ID that can be used for uniquely
identifying the address within a connection for address removal. The
Address ID is also used to identify MP_JOIN options (see {{MP_JOIN}})
relating to the same address, even when address translators are in use.
The Address ID MUST uniquely identify the address for the sender of the
option (within the scope of the connection); the mechanism for
allocating such IDs is implementation specific.

All Address IDs learned via either MP_JOIN or ADD_ADDR SHOULD be stored
by the receiver in a data structure that gathers all the
Address-ID-to-address mappings for a connection (identified by a token
pair). In this way, there is a stored mapping between the Address ID,
observed source address, and token pair for future processing of control
information for a connection.
  
Ideally, ADD_ADDR and REMOVE_ADDR options would be sent reliably, and in
order, to the other end. This would ensure that this address management
does not unnecessarily cause an outage in the connection when remove/add
addresses are processed in reverse order, and also to ensure that all
possible paths are used. Note, however, that losing reliability and
ordering will not break the multipath connections, it will just reduce
the opportunity to open new paths and to survive different
patterns of path failures.

Therefore, implementing reliability signals for these DCCP options is
not necessary.  In order to minimize the impact of the loss of these
options, however, it is RECOMMENDED that a sender should send these
options on all available subflows.  If these options need to be received
in-order, an implementation SHOULD only send one ADD_ADDR/REMOVE_ADDR
option per RTT, to minimize the risk of misordering. A host that
receives an ADD_ADDR but finds a connection set up to that IP address
and port number is unsuccessful SHOULD NOT perform further connection
attempts to this address/port combination for this connection. A sender
that wants to trigger a new incoming connection attempt on a previously
advertised address/port combination can therefore refresh ADD_ADDR
information by sending the option again.

[TBD/TBV]


### MP_REMOVEADDR {#MP_REMOVEADDR}

If, during the lifetime of an MP-DCCP connection, a previously announced
address becomes invalid (e.g., if the interface disappears), the
affected host SHOULD announce this so that the peer can remove subflows
related to this address.

This is achieved through the Remove Address (REMOVE_ADDR) option which
will remove a previously added address (or list of addresses) from a
connection and terminate any subflows currently using that address.

For security purposes, if a host receives a REMOVE_ADDR option, it must
ensure the affected path(s) are no longer in use before it instigates
closure. Typical DCCP validity tests on the subflow (e.g., packet type
specific sequence and acknowledgement number check) MUST also be
undertaken. An implementation can use indications of these test failures
as part of intrusion detection or error logging.

The sending and receipt of this message SHOULD trigger the sending of
DCCP-Close and DCCP-Reset by client and server, respectively on the
affected subflow(s) (if possible), as a courtesy to cleaning up
middlebox state, before cleaning up any local state.

Address removal is undertaken by ID, so as to permit the use of NATs and
other middleboxes that rewrite source addresses.  If there is no address
at the requested ID, the receiver will silently ignore the request.

### MP_PRIO {#MP_PRIO}

In the event that a single specific path out of the set of available
paths shall be treated with higher priority compared to the others, a
host may wish to signal such change in priority  to the peer.
One reason for such behavior is due to the different costs involved in
using different paths (e.g., WiFi is free while cellular has limit on
volume, 5G has higher energy consumption). Also, the priority of a path
may be subject to dynamic changes, for example when the mobile runs out
of battery only a single path may be preferred. Therefore, the path
priority should be considered when making packet scheduling decisions.


The MP_PRIO option, shown below, can be used to set a priority flag
for the path which is specified by the AddrID field that uniquely
identifies the path. The option can be sent over any path.

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   |     Type      |     Length    |Subtype| Prio  | AddrID       |
   +---------------+---------------+-------+-------+--------------+
~~~~

The following values are available for Prio field:

*   0: Do not use. The path is not available.
*   1: Standby: do not use this path for traffic scheduling, if another
       path (secondary or primary) is available.
*   2: Secondary: do not use this path for traffic scheduling, if the other
       paths are good enough. The path will be used occasionally, e.g. when
       primary paths are congested or become not available..
*   3: Always: can use the path in any way deemed reasonable by peer. Will
       always be used for packet scheduling decisions.
*   4 - 15: relative priority of one path over the other to give relative
       path priority for primary paths. The peer should
       consider sending more traffic over higher priority path.

Example use cases include:
1) Setting Wi-Fi path to Always and Cellular paths to Secondary. In this case
   Wi-Fi will be used and Cellular only if the Wi-Fi path is congested or not
   available.
2) Setting Wi-Fi path to Always and Cellular to Standby. In this case Wi-Fi
   will be used and Cellular only if the Wi-Fi is not available.
3) Setting Wi-Fi path to Always and Cellular path to Always. In this case,
   all packets can be scheduled  over all paths leading to high capacity and
   and high energy efficiency.

[TBD/TBV also consider rate limiting a given path]

{: #ref-mp-dccp-handshaking title='Example MP-DCCP Handshake'}

The basic initial handshake for the first flow is as follows:

* Host A sends a DCCP-Request with the MP-Capable feature Change
  request and the MP_KEY option with Host-specific Key-A

* Host B sends a DCCP-Response with Confirm feature for
  MP-Capable and the MP_Key option with Host-specific Key-B

* Host A sends a DCCP-Ack with both Keys echoed to Host B.

The handshake for subsequent flows based on a successful initial
handshake is as follows:

* Host A sends a DCCP-Request with the MP-Capable feature Change
  request and the MP_JOIN option with Host B’s Token TB, generated from
  the derived key by applying a SHA-1 hash and truncating to the first
  32 bits. Additionally, an own random nonce RA is transmitted with the
  MP_JOIN.

* Host B computes the HMAC of the DCCP-Request and sends a DCCP-Response
  with Confirm feature option for MP-Capable and the MP_JOIN option with
  the Token TB and a random nonce RB together with the computed MP_HMAC.

* Host A sends a DCCP-Ack with the HMAC computed for the DCCP-Response.

* Host B sends a DCCP-Ack confirm the HMAC and to conclude the
  handshaking.


## Fallback

When a subflow fails to operate within the MP-DCCP requirements, it is 
necessary to fall back to the safe operation. This may be either falling back 
to regular DCCP, or removing a problematic subflow. The main reason for 
subflow failing is loss of MP-DCCP options. 

At the start of the MP-DCCP connection, the handshake ensures exchange of MP-DCCP
options and thus ensures that the path is fully MP-DCCP capable. If during the
handshake procedure it appears that DCCP-Request or DCCP-response or DCCP-Ack
messages don’t have the MP-DCCP options, the MP-DCCP connection will not be 
established and the handshake should fall back to regular DCCP. 

If a subflow attempts to join an existing MP-DCCP connection, but MP-DCCP options 
are not present in the handshake messages, that subflow will be closed.   



# Security Considerations {#security}

Similar to DCCP, MP-DCCP does not provide cryptographic security
guarantees inherently. Thus, if applications need cryptographic security
(integrity, authentication, confidentiality, access control, and
anti-replay protection) the use of IPsec or some other kind of
end-to-end security is recommended;
Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) {{RFC3711}} is one candidate
protocol for authentication. Together with Encryption of Header
Extensions in SRTP, as provided by {{RFC6904}}, also integrity would
be provided.

As described in {{RFC4340}}, DCCP provides protection against hijacking
and limits the potential impact of some denial-of-service attacks, but
DCCP provides no inherent protection against attackers’ snooping on data
packets. Regarding the security of MP-DCCP no additional risks should be
introduced compared to regular DCCP of today. Thereof derived are the
following key security requirements to be fulfilled by MP-DCCP:

* Provide a mechanism to confirm that parties involved in a subflow
  handshake are identical to those in the original connection setup.
* Provide verification that the new address to be included in a MP
  connection is valid for a peer to receive traffic at before using it.
* Provide replay protection, i.e., ensure that a request to add/remove a
  subflow is 'fresh'. 

In order to achieve these goals, MP-DCCP includes a hash-based handshake
algorithm documented in Sections {{MP_KEY}} and {{handshaking}}. The
security of the MP-DCCP connection depends on the use of keys that are
shared once at the start of the first subflow and are never sent again
over the network. To ease demultiplexing while not giving away any
cryptographic material, future subflows use a truncated cryptographic
hash of this key as the connection identification "token". The keys are
concatenated and used as keys for creating Hash-based Message
Authentication Codes (HMACs) used on subflow setup, in order to verify
that the parties in the handshake are the same as in the original
connection setup. It also provides verification that the peer can
receive traffic at this new address. Replay attacks would still be
possible when only keys are used;
therefore, the handshakes use single-use random numbers (nonces) at both
ends -- this ensures that the HMAC will never be the same on two handshakes.
Guidance on generating random numbers suitable for use as keys is given
in {{RFC4086}}. During normal operation, regular DCCP protection
mechanisms (such as header checksum to protect DCCP headers against
corruption) will provide the same level of protection against attacks on
individual DCCP subflows as exists for regular DCCP today. 


# Interactions with Middleboxes {#middlebox}

Issues from interaction with on-path middleboxes such as NATs, firewalls, proxies,
intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and others have to be considered for all
extensions to standard protocols since otherwise unexpected reactions of
middleboxes may hinder its deployment. DCCP already provides means to
mitigate the potential impact of middleboxes, also in comparison to TCP (see
{{RFC4043}}, sect. 16). In case, however, both hosts are located behind a NAT or
firewall entity, specific measures have to be applied such as the {{RFC5596}}-specified
simultaneous-open technique that update the (traditionally asymmetric)
connection-establishment procedures for DCCP.  Further standardized technologies
addressing NAT type middleboxes are covered by {{RFC5597}}.

{{RFC6773}} specifies UDP Encapsulation for NAT Traversal of DCCP sessions,
similar to other UDP encapsulations such as for SCTP {{RFC6951}}. The alternative
U-DCCP approach proposed in {{I-D.amend-tsvwg-dccp-udp-header-conversion}} would
reduce tunneling overhead. The handshaking procedure for DCCP-UDP
header conversion or use of a DCCP-UDP negotiation procedure to signal support
for DCCP-UDP header conversion would require encapsulation during the handshakes
and use of two additional port numbers out of the UDP port number space, but
would require zero overhead afterwards.


# Implementation

The approach described above has been implemented in open source across different testbeds and a new scheduling algorithm has been extensively tested. Also 
demonstrations of a laboratory setup have been executed and have been published at {{website}}.

# IANA Considerations

This document defines one new value to DCCP feature list and one new
DCCP Option with ten corresponding Subtypes as follows. 
This document defines a new DCCP feature parameter for negotiating
the support of multipath capability for DCCP sessions between hosts
as described in Section 3. The following entry in {{ref-add-feature-list}} should be
added to the "Feature Numbers Registry" according to {{RFC4340}}, Section 19.4. under the "DCCP Protocol" heading. 

| Value | Feature Name               | Specification   |
|:-----:|:--------------------------:|:---------------:|
| 0x10  | MP-DCCP capability feature | {{mp_capable}}  |
{:#ref-add-feature-list title='Addition to DCCP Feature list Entries'}

This document defines a new DCCP protocol option of type=46 as described in Section 3.2 together with 10 additional sub-options.
The following entries in {{ref-add-proto-opt-list}} should be added to the "DCCP
Protocol options" and assigned as "MP-DCCP sub-options", respectively.
